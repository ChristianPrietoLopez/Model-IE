<h2>7.2 – Modal Oscillation Formulas in the IE Model</h2>
<p>This section summarizes the fundamental formulas that describe neutrino oscillations within the Iterative Energetic (IE) Model, using a purely energetic and modal framework instead of mass-based quantum states.</p>
<h3>16. Neutrino Oscillation Probability – P(ν_α → ν_β)</h3>
<p><strong>P(ν_α → ν_β) = sin²(2θ) · sin²(1.27 · Δm² · L / E)</strong></p>
<p>This is the standard probability of transition from flavor α to β over a distance L and energy E. In the IE model, it emerges from modal energy shifts rather than flavor mixing between mass eigenstates.</p>
<ul>
<li>θ: Mixing angle between energetic modes (e.g., 0.5 rad)</li>
<li>Δm²: Effective modal energy gap (e.g., 2.4×10⁻³ eV²)</li>
<li>L: Path traveled by the neutrino-like excitation</li>
<li>E: Energy of the excitation</li>
</ul>
<h3>17. Mixing Angle – θ</h3>
<p><strong>sin²(2θ) = 4 · |U_{α1}|² · |U_{β1}|²</strong></p>
<p>The mixing angle represents how flavor-like states (e.g. ν_e, ν_μ) project onto internal modal structures via the Pontecorvo mixing matrix.</p>
<h3>18. Mass-Squared Difference – Δm²</h3>
<p><strong>Δm² = m²₃ − m²₂</strong></p>
<p>This classical parameter in neutrino physics corresponds to the energy difference between modes in the IE Model, determining the oscillation frequency.</p>
<h3>Interpretation within the IE Framework</h3>
<p>Rather than attributing oscillations to mass eigenstate interference, the IE Model attributes them to dynamic reorganizations between energy modes. The observed patterns arise from energetic transitions inside the stabilized quantum remnant, respecting the same mathematical structure but with a different physical basis.</p>
