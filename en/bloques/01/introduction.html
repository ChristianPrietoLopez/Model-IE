<h2>Block 1 â€“ General Introduction to the IE Model</h2>
<p>The Iterative Energetic (IE) Model offers a new perspective on the universe, where time, cosmic expansion, and reality itself emerge from continuous energetic flow.</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Foundation:</strong> Time is not absolute; it emerges from energy transformations (iterances).</li>
    <li><strong>Objective:</strong> To reproduce known cosmic and quantum phenomena without invoking inflation or a cosmological constant.</li>
    <li><strong>Applications:</strong> Cosmology, quantum physics, dark matter, neutrinos, FRBs, black holes, and more.</li>
</ul>
